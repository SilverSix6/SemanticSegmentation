 * @param cluster_centers: A pointer to an array of clusters. 
 * @param segmented_matrix: Pointer to the output matrix of the same dimentions as the input image. Each pixel is assigned the id of the closest cluster.
 * @param width: The width of the image (number of pixels)
 * @param height: The height of the image (number of pixels)
 * @param num_clusters: The number of clusters 
 * @param m: The compactness factor. Used to balance spatial and color proximity. Higher values enforce spatial uniformity.
